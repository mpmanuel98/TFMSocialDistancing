Module ocv_face_processing.py.

In this module there are some definitions ir order to detect faces and
to create the necessary structures to make the subsequent face
recognition. Also, there is a Class to create Recognizer instances using
a specified algorithm. For all the face processes OpenCV algorithms
are used.

Also some functions are defined:
